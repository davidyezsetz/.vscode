# GitLens

GitLens **supercharges** the built-in Visual Studio Code Git capabilities. It helps you to **visualize code authorship** at a glance via inline Git blame annotations and code lens, **seamlessly navigate and explore** the history of a file or branch, **gain valuable insights** via powerful comparision commands, and so much more.

GitLens provides an unobtrusive blame annotation at the end of the selected line, a status bar item showing the commit author and date of the selected line, code lens showing the most recent commit and # of authors of the file and/or code block, and many commands for exploring commits and histories, comparing and navigating revisions, stash access, repository status, and more. GitLens is also [highly customizable](#extension-settings) to meet your specific needs — find code lens intrusive or the selected line blame annotation distracting — no problem, it is easy to [turn them off or change how they behave](#extension-settings).

## Previews
#### Featuring code lens, whole file inline blame annotations, and navigation and exploration via quick pick menus
![GitLens preview 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eamodio/vscode-git-codelens/master/images/gitlens-preview1.gif)

#### Featuring selected line blame annotation and hovers, status bar commit details, quick pick menus, compare with previous, and more
![GitLens preview 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eamodio/vscode-git-codelens/master/images/gitlens-preview2.gif)

## Features

#### Git Blame Annotations

- Adds a **blame annotation** to the end of the selected line showing the commit id and message, with more details in a hover popup ([optional](#extension-settings), on by default)

- Adds a `Toggle Blame Annotations` command (`gitlens.toggleBlame`) with a shortcut of `alt+b` to toggle **inline Git blame annotations** for a whole file with multiple styles — compact, expanded, and trailing
  - Also adds a `Show Blame Annotations` command (`gitlens.showBlame`)

- Adds **author and date blame information** about the selected line to the **status bar** ([optional](#extension-settings), on by default)
  - By default clicking on the status bar shows a **commit details quick pick menu** with commands for comparing, navigating and exploring commits, and more

  - Provides [customizable](#extension-settings) click behavior of the status bar — choose between one of the following
    - Toggle whole file blame annotations on and off
    - Toggle code lens on and off — only available if [`"gitlens.codeLens.visibility": "ondemand"`](#extension-settings) is set
    - Compare the file with the previous commit
    - Show a quick pick menu with details and commands for the commit
    - Show a quick pick menu with file details and commands for the commit
    - Show a quick pick menu with the commit history of the file

    - By default, clicking on the code lens toggles the inline Git blame annotations on and off for the whole file
    - Will be hidden if the author of the most recent commit is also the only author of the file or block, to avoid duplicate information and reduce visual noise

- Provides [customizable](#extension-settings) click behavior for each code lens — choose between one of the following
  - Toggle whole file blame annotations on and off
  - Compare the file with the previous commit
  - Show a quick pick menu with details and commands for the commit
  - Show a quick pick menu with file details and commands for the commit

## Known Issues

- If the `Copy to * clipboard` commands don't work on Linux -- `xclip` needs to be installed. You can install it via `sudo apt-get install xclip`
- Visible whitespace causes issues ([vscode issue #11485](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/11485)) with the `expanded` and `compact` blame annotation styles when using a non-monospace font -- set `"gitlens.advanced.toggleWhitespace.enabled": true` if you are using a non-monospace font
